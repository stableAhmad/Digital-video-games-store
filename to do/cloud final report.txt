Sure, I'd be happy to explain it again! Here's a breakdown of what a website like G2A does, how it works, and some examples:

What does a website like G2A do?

    Offers a digital marketplace for buying and selling game keys, software keys, and other digital products
    Allows third-party sellers to offer their products for sale on the platform
    Offers discounted prices on digital products compared to official retailers

How does it work?

    Customers can browse and purchase products directly from the website
    Third-party sellers can offer their products for sale on the platform, and G2A takes a commission on each sale
    Payment and delivery of the product is generally handled by the platform in a secure manner

Examples of websites like G2A:

    CDKeys
    Gamivo
    Green Man Gaming
    Instant Gaming

It's important to note that while these websites are popular and generally considered trustworthy, there have been concerns in the past about the legitimacy of some of the keys sold on these marketplaces. As with any online purchase, it's important to do your research and exercise caution when buying digital products from third-party marketplaces.


SQL databases are designed to handle a high volume of transactions and provide strong consistency guarantees. Transactions are a way to group multiple database operations into a single unit of work that either succeeds or fails as a whole. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even if there are errors or failures during the transaction.

For example, an e-commerce website like CDKeys might require transactions for operations such as placing an order, updating inventory, and processing payments. In such cases, it's important to ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate, even under heavy loads.

SQL databases also provide powerful querying capabilities, such as joins and aggregation, which can be useful for complex data retrieval operations. They also support data integrity constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints, which help to maintain data consistency and prevent data corruption.

Overall, SQL databases are a good fit for applications that require strong transactional guarantees, complex querying capabilities, and a well-defined schema.
